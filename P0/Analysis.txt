Task0 - The time complexity is O(1). The rate of the output does not chage as the list grows longer. 

Task1 - I used 2 for loops to get the numbers from the calls and texts lists that is linear time for each list. So the complexity is O(n + m).

Task2 - I used a for loop to get the callers and the recievers from the calls list. That gives me linear time. So O(n).

Task3 - The overall complexity is O(n(k + m)). The main function is (getAreaCodeList). n being the number of total calls, k the first 4 characters in each Bangolre numbers , m the number of characters in each
     area code called by banglore number. I looped through the calls to get the Banglore callers then get the area code for each call reciever
     from those callers.
     To print the results for both parts, I used the getAreaCodeList. Sorted the list (O(nlog(n) smaller than O(n(k + m)) then loop through the 
     list to print the codes (O(n) smaller than O(n(k + m)). 
     I also calculated the length of the list (O(1). 


Task4 - I loop through the texts list to get both senders and recievers number with a for loop. That's O(n).
         Then looped through the calls to get the recievers. that's O(m). Looped through the calls again to filter calls that are not in the texts or call recievers' lists. 
         that's O(m). So O(n + m).
