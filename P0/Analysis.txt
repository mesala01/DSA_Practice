Task0 - The time complexity is O(1). The rate of the output does not chage as the list grows longer. 

Task1 - I used 2 for loops to get the numbers from the calls and texts lists that is linear time for each list. So the complexity is O(n), n being 
          the number of unique telephone numbers.

Task2 - I used a for loop to get the callers and the recievers from the calls list. That gives me linear time. So O(n), n is the number of calls in the calls list.

Task3 - The overall complexity is O(nlogn). The main function is (getAreaCodeList) and is of O(n) n being the number of total calls.
         However I sorted the set in the printResult function and that gives a O(nlogn) overall.


Task4 - I loop through the texts list to get both senders and recievers number with a for loop. That's O(n).
         Then looped through the calls to get the recievers. that's O(m). I sorted telemarketers list before printing the numbers. That gives a O(nlogn) overall.
